Problem 1 - 
A residential building contains apartments that house tenants. Apartments are numbered, and can either be a rental (monthly fee), a condo (owned by tenant), or unoccupied. 
Your task:
Write a tenant class that can describe a person who occupies an apartment. Tenants have names and occupations.
Write a building class that maintains an association of tenants to apartments. An apartment can have zero or more tenants, and can be either a rental or condo but not both. The building should provide methods to get/set tenants for an apartment, get/set the type of a unit, and print the current count of apartments by type.
Write demonstration code in a main that creates a building with 100 apartments and 75 tenants. The apartments must consist of a mix of types (rental, condo, unoccupied), but the ratio is up to you.  Call the print method for your building. 


Problem 2 - 
Create a pygame based circle class.
Create a button class to process mouse events. Use existing button images from our class as button up and down images.  
Use the pygame template to write a program that creates a button using the button class.
When the button is clicked a new circle (use the circle class) should get added to the window at a random position.
When the mouse is clicked on a circle it should disappear.
